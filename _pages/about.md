**Welcome!**
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Management Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University (ZJU), expecting to graduate in June 2026. My research focuses on peer effects, social networks, habit formation, and decision-making. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Fadong Chen](https://fadongchen.weebly.com/) (ZJU), Professor Colin Camerer [Colin Camerer](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/colin-f-camerer), and Professor [Yubai Yuan](https://yubaiyuan-stats.github.io/) (Penn State).

My research investigates how system-gaming behavior spreads through social networks, combining natural experiments, archival data, and machine learning methods to understand how peer influence drives these behaviors and the development of related habits.

Currently, I am a visiting student at Caltech, working with Professor Camerer, where I have the opportunity to explore the formation of habits in greater depth.


<!-- In the future, I hope to study dishonest behavior in a lab to gain insights into why people make these choices.-->
