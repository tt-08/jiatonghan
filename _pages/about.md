**Welcome!**
I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in Management Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University (ZJU), expecting to graduate in June 2026. My research focuses on peer effects, social networks, habit formation, and decision-making. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Fadong Chen](https://fadongchen.weebly.com/) (ZJU), Professor [Colin Camerer](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/colin-f-camerer) (Caltech), and Professor [Yubai Yuan](https://yubaiyuan-stats.github.io/) (Penn State).

My research investigates how system-gaming behavior spreads through social networks, combining natural experiments, archival data, and machine learning methods to understand how peer influence drives these behaviors and the development of related habits.

I spent two years as a visiting student at Caltech, working with Professor Camerer, where I had the opportunity to explore the formation of habits in greater depth.


<!-- In the future, I hope to study dishonest behavior in a lab to gain insights into why people make these choices.-->


<!-- I’m a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Management Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University (ZJU). Before joining ZJU, I earned my B.A. in Logistics Engineering from Chongqing University (CQU).

Currently, I am a visiting student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working under the supervision of Professor Colin Camerer. 

My graduate research focuses on peer effects, social networks, habit, and decision making, guided by Professor Fadong Chen and Professor Yubai Yuan. -->
