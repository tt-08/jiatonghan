**Welcome!**
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Management Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University (ZJU). My research primarily focuses on peer effects, social networks, habit formation, and decision-making. I am guided by Professor Fadong Chen from ZJU and Professor Yubai Yuan from Pennsylvania State University (PSU), as I work to uncover the broader social dynamics and behavioral mechanisms behind dishonest behavior within social networks.

My work examines human behavior in field settings, leveraging natural experiments and archival data. Recently, I have developed a strong interest in using machine learning and economic models to analyze the role of peer influence in the diffusion of dishonesty. This approach allows me to explore not only the immediate impact of peer effects but also how habits related to dishonesty form and persist over time, contributing to the understanding of these complex social phenomena.

Currently, I am a visiting student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working under the supervision of Professor Colin Camerer. This opportunity enables me to deepen my exploration into habits, social networks, and decision-making, with access to cutting-edge research facilities and interdisciplinary insights.

In the future, I hope to study the decision-making processes underlying dishonest behavior in a lab setting. This will allow me to approach dishonest behavior from a more controlled perspective, shedding light on the factors that drive individuals to act dishonestly.
