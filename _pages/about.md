**Welcome!**

Iâ€™m a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Management at Zhejiang University (ZJU). Before joining ZJU, I earned my B.A. in Logistics Engineering from Chongqing University (CQU).

Currently, I am a visiting student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working under the supervision of Professor Colin Camerer. 

My graduate research focuses on peer effects, social networks, habit, and decision making, guided by Professor Fadong Chen.
