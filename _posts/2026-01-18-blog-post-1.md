**The Long Game**

As a visiting student at Caltech, I had the privilege of hearing Jensen Huang speak at the 2024 commencement. He told a story about a gardener who tended a huge temple with tiny tweezers, saying:

“I have cared for my garden for 25 years. I have plenty of time.”

This became my mindset. I chose research as my career. Because I am dedicated to this path for the long run, the rush disappears.

**I have plenty of time.**
